# Velocity-Web-Kit

Only works in Google Chrome. Only useful for Easton Velocity Technical Support most likely. 

chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, load this as "Unpacked Extension". It will throw errors due to developer mode/unpacked extension being loaded when browser starts up each time. Too lazy to put it on the extension store.
